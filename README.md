[00:00.44] This is a home of massive dance records
[00:02.39] Classic pop music, good times
[00:04.44] And people staying up long
[00:05.02] After their bed time
[00:15.02] 
[00:16.40] Like a school digger, she's a scrub with grass stubble
[00:19.75] But now they pick up the tickets down, they don't cross the cement town
[00:23.73] Give the chief a check, but keep the people from getting high
[00:27.92] So, as you see it, it's the same, but I need all the herbs
[00:56.92] 
[01:37.05] Let this flow, leave this shit, she's a scrub with grass stubble
[01:40.98] But now they pick up the tickets down, they don't cross the cement town
[01:44.74] Give the chief a check, but keep the people from getting high
[01:48.79] So, as you see it, it's the same, but i need all the herbs
[02:17.79] 
[01:53.04] Let this flow, leave this shit, she's a scrub with grass stubble
[01:56.34] But now they pick up the tickets down, they don't cross the cement town
[02:00.59] Give the chief a check, but keep the people from getting high
[02:04.80] So, as you see it, it's the same, but I need all the herbs
